Combining data from party manifestos with a Regression Discontinuity Design, this article finds that a populist party obtaining representation constitutes a supply-side mechanism inducing an adjustment over mainstream parties‚Äô positions, independently from public opinion changes. After competing with a populist party, mainstream parties shift their positions in favor of a smaller and more exclusionary welfare state. In terms of programmatic distances, mainstream parties tend to converge with the populists on both the cultural and economic dimension of the welfare state issue."

    "text": "Hello and welcome to my website!\nI‚Äôm an applied economist with experience in empirical solutions to socio-economic issues. I am currently a Ph.D.¬†candidate at UNAV (University of Navarre, Spain).\nI‚Äôm interested especially interested in how economic and political systems interact with each other and shape the underying mechanisms of the societies we live in. More in general, I believe in the power of empirical evidence and how this can help to find solutions to real-world problems.\nI‚Äôm passionate about data analytics, data visualization, and programming.\nThis website contains part of my work as a researcher, teacher, and data scientist. This includes research articles, pieces of code and datasets, presentations, and teaching materials. You can find further materials at my GitHub page."
